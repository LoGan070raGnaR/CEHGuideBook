# Footprinting and Reconnaissance

## Introduction

-   **Footprinting** refers to collecting information about a target network from publicly accessible sources. It involves creating a blueprint or "footprint" of the organization, aiding in the selection of effective attack strategies.

-   **Reconnaissance** is the initial step in any system attack, involving the collection of information to narrow down efforts and choose attack weapons.

As an ethical hacker in a large organization, your task is to perform a proactive security assessment. Before starting, discuss and define the scope with management and establish rules of engagement (RoE).

## Objective

Extract information about the target organization, including:

- **Organization Information:** Employee details, addresses, partner details, weblinks, web technologies, patents, trademarks, etc.
- **Network Information:** Domains, sub-domains, network blocks, topologies, routers, firewalls, IP addresses, Whois records, DNS records, etc.
- **System Information:** Operating systems, web server OSes, web server locations, user accounts, passwords, etc.

## Overview of Footprinting

- **Footprinting** involves collecting information about a target network and its environment to evaluate the security posture. It can be passive or active.
    - **Passive Footprinting:** Gathering information without direct interaction, useful when detection is undesirable.
    - **Active Footprinting:** Gathering information with direct interaction, where the target may recognize the process.

## Task
